# Kawaegle dotfiles

## Introduction

These are my dotfiles I use as a daily driver. It contains config files for kitty and nvim mostly, but you can also find configs for ZSH, ranger or mvp. In `script`, you can find little scripts I did too.

## Documentation

I'm currently working on documentation. As soon as these dots were originally made for me, I didn't take the time to comment them really well, neither document them.
But you can already find my NVim's configuration documentation (here)[https://github.com/EvanKoe/KawaegleDotfiles/blob/main/nvim/README.md].
